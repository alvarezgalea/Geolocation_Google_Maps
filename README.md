Code in Javascript using Google Map API

This is a code to paint in the google maps several points using diferent icons. This example is about the customers ubication's in a google map. 
I want to kwon where is the customers that paied and not paied with diferents icons.

The customers that paied is show in green icon and the customer thar not paied is show in red icon.
Your principal icon with the name "Principal Point" is the same that the google map using to show the point. It's your principal point.
This code is in Javascript and using de Funtions you can resolve several problems.

You can use the code and updating.

Thanks for visit the git.
